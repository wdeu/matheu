        <h1>About MathEU</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">Pedagogy & Background</p>
        
        <p style="font-style: italic; color: #6b7280; margin-bottom: 2rem;">
            For teachers and parents
        </p>
        
        <h2>Where does MathEU come from?</h2>
        
        <p>
            MathEU is based on the mental math concept developed by <strong>Grundschule Op de Host</strong> in Horst (Schleswig-Holstein, Germany), which received the German School Award in 2023. The school created a structured system where children can systematically practice mental arithmetic through 16 progressive levels.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            A former student of the school implemented this concept as a German-language open-source application. MathEU builds on this foundation and makes it available in multiple languages – currently eight European languages.
        </p>
        
        <h2>The pedagogical concept</h2>
        
        <h3>1. Self-directed learning</h3>
        
        <p>
            In <strong>Practice Mode</strong>, children can choose which operation and difficulty level they want to practice. There is no traditional right or wrong – each problem receives encouraging feedback, and children can work at their own pace.
        </p>
        
        <h3>2. Structured progression (16 levels)</h3>
        
        <p>
            In <strong>Level Mode</strong>, problems follow the tier system from Grundschule Op de Host:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Levels build on each other (e.g., first addition within 10, then within 20)</li>
            <li>Each level unlocks only after completing the previous one with at least 80% correct answers</li>
            <li>Children experience small, achievable learning steps instead of overwhelming challenges</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>3. Mental math without distraction</h3>
        
        <p>
            The app offers a <strong>Mental Math Mode</strong> where problems are only read aloud without numbers appearing on screen. This mirrors traditional classroom mental arithmetic and encourages focus on mental calculation.
        </p>
        
        <h3>4. Positive feedback</h3>
        
        <p>
            Instead of error counting, MathEU works with encouraging responses. Four different feedback styles (encouraging, simple, playful, teacher-like) can be selected – depending on what motivates the child.
        </p>
        
        <h2>What makes MathEU different?</h2>
        
        <h3>Multilingualism as core feature</h3>
        
        <p>
            Unlike the original German-only version, MathEU supports eight languages: <strong>German, English, French, Portuguese, Spanish, Italian, Polish, and Ukrainian</strong>.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            This selection is based on the most common first and second languages among elementary school children in Europe:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>English</strong> is learned as a foreign language by 83% of all EU primary students – by far the most important school language</li>
            <li><strong>German</strong> is the most common native language in the EU (19% of EU citizens)</li>
            <li><strong>French</strong> is spoken as a native language by 15% of EU citizens</li>
            <li><strong>Italian</strong> (13% of EU citizens) and <strong>Polish</strong> (9%, disproportionately represented among children due to young population structure)</li>
            <li><strong>Spanish</strong> (9% of EU, increasingly from Latin American immigration)</li>
            <li><strong>Ukrainian</strong>: Since 2022, a major factor – around 700,000 Ukrainian children were enrolled in EU schools in 2023/24, most at primary level</li>
            <li><strong>Portuguese</strong>: For Portuguese and Brazilian families in Europe</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
            Multilingualism makes MathEU particularly valuable for:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Children growing up bilingual</li>
            <li>Classrooms with high migration backgrounds</li>
            <li>Language support (combining math + foreign language)</li>
            <li>International schools</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Technical implementation for classroom use</h3>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>No registration required</strong>: The app runs directly in the browser</li>
            <li><strong>Works offline</strong>: After initial loading, it functions without internet</li>
            <li><strong>No tracking</strong>: No data is collected or transmitted to servers</li>
            <li><strong>Free</strong>: No ads, no in-app purchases</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Text-to-speech</h3>
        
        <p>
            The app uses the device's built-in speech synthesis (smartphone, tablet, computer) to read problems aloud. This works in all eight languages and can be individually adjusted – helpful for children with reading difficulties or when learning languages.
        </p>
        
        <div class="highlight">
            <p style="margin: 0;"><strong>💡 Tip for better voice quality:</strong> Speech output can be improved by installing free language packs on your device:</p>
            <ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 0 1.5rem;">
                <li><strong>iPhone/iPad</strong>: Settings → Accessibility → Spoken Content → Voices → download desired language</li>
                <li><strong>Android</strong>: Settings → Language & Input → Text-to-Speech → Install voice</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0 0; font-size: 0.9rem;">Especially recommended when children practice in a language other than the system language.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Who is MathEU for?</h2>
        
        <h3>Primary: Elementary school children (Grades 1-4)</h3>
        
        <p>
            The problems align with elementary curricula and cover the four basic operations up to 100. Through adjustable difficulty levels, the app can be used by both first-graders and advanced fourth-graders.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Multilingual families</h3>
        
        <p>
            Children growing up bilingual or learning a foreign language can practice problems in different languages in MathEU. This combines mathematics with language development.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Teachers</h3>
        
        <p>
            The app is suitable for:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Independent work phases</li>
            <li>Differentiation (each child works at their level)</li>
            <li>Substitute teaching</li>
            <li>Support instruction</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>What MathEU is not</h2>
        
        <p>
            MathEU does <strong>not</strong> replace mathematics instruction. The app exclusively trains mental arithmetic – an important but small part of mathematical learning. Topics like geometry, word problems, or mathematical problem-solving are deliberately not covered.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The app is also not a reward system with points, stars, or leaderboards. There are no gamification elements that could distract from actual learning.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Technical background</h2>
        
        <p>
            MathEU is an open-source web application developed with modern web technologies (React, Vite). The complete source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/wdeu/matheu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a>. The app is developed as a volunteer project and can be used by anyone free of charge.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Multilingualism was implemented with the help of Claude (an AI assistant from Anthropic), with all translations reviewed by native-speaking educators.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Contact and feedback</h2>
        
        <p>
            Feedback about the app is welcome – especially from teachers using MathEU in the classroom. Write to: <a href="mailto:dev@wdeu.de">dev@wdeu.de</a>
